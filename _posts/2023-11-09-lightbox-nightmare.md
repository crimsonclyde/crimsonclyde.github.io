# Tales from the printer

Recently BambuLab launched their new website makerworld and a damn pretty great contenst named [Halloween](https://makerworld.com/en/contests/1#tab-Winner).
Worth spending some time their, models getting better each year. So why not fire up the printer and get myself a lightbox?

Test ok'ish (things to improve) and speaking of famous last words:

These are only a few of them. I bought 10 ESP8266 modules - and had some leftovers. Well, down to one or two now. And don't ask 7 meters of WS2812b lightstrips. There is more, I never thought that I will ever run out of micro USB cables - well ... I do.  

And since I need to complete it all - I created my own lightbox out of an SVG from my work.

We start with a real sad topic.
Amalia is no more. 2019 until 2024. Finally gone for good shipped to the netherlands.  
May here entire life on all her four wheels be always in pure sunshine and may she drive on great roads with her roof open wide.  

Here we are now, without wheels.  
Really? Of course not! 

Out of the shadows a new ride arrived.   
This time - totally different.   
Gone are the convertible times long live the new banger.  
And what a machine it is. 

**â™¥ #VanLife**

Of course this is pure ironic - I am ptotally aware that VanLife is just a buzzword.  
I don't expect it to be like you will see those people on YouTube.  
Epierence will be so much more different in the real world. 

- You cannot simply park and sleep everywhere you are. 
- You don't have access to a shower and a real toilette. 
- The space is cramped 
- Campers are hillarious expensive. 
- Campers are to big for cities
My approach is a half / half decision. Still a car and not a entire Camper. It's the equivalent to a VW Bully Campervan. It's a Ford Nugget which is based on a Ford Transit.


Good thing is - I don't own this car nor do I used leasing for it.  
Technically I am the driver and that's fine.  
I have this car for a year and let's see how we use it.

>I, شكل عبدال شَكْرُون (Chakal abd al Chakroun), say this to you:
The Elder Gods have put the damned
To sleep. And they that tamper with the seals
And wake the sleepers, too, are damned.
And I say further, herein lies those spells
To break the seals that hold in thrall
Cthulhu and his ebon horde. For I
Have spent my life to learn them all.
So, fool, the darkness is pent up in space:
The gates to Hell are closed. You
Meddle at your own expense: When you call
They will wake and answer you.
This is my gift to mankind -- here are the keys.
Find your own locks; be glad.
I, شكل عبدال شَكْرُون say this to you:
I, who tampered, and am mad.

The book of evil;
bound in human skin;
bound with neverending hatred;
bonded ad infinitum;
Behold the end is nigh'.
Cthulhu fataghn.

May I present the ultimate edition of the Necronomicon!

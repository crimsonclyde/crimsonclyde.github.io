>We,  
شكل عبدال شَكْرُون (Chakal abd al Chakroun) and
خليل  ال جَمَال   (Jamyra El Khaleel),
say this to you:  
The Elder Gods have put the damned  
To sleep. And they that tamper with the seals  
And wake the sleepers, too, are damned.  
And I say further, herein lies those spells  
To break the seals that hold in thrall  
Cthulhu and his ebon horde. For I  
Have spent my life to learn them all.  
So, fool, the darkness is pent up in space:  
The gates to Hell are closed. You  
Meddle at your own expense: When you call  
They will wake and answer you.  
This is my gift to mankind -- here are the keys.  
Find your own locks; be glad.  
I, شكل عبدال شَكْرُون say this to you:  
I, who tampered, and am mad.

Bound in human skin;  
weighted by the cthulu mythos itself;  
bound with tears and blood;  
bonded ad infinitum;    
behold Cthulhu is nigh'.  

Let us simply add that it is our very good honor to present you  
the book of the dead. **The Necronomicon**

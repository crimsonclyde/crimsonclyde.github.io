The last remaining piece arrived. The map of Arkham.  
The frame is nothing special, I tried to get something 1920ies from a flea markt, but obviously I did not find anything.

Apart from that I am very pleased with the result.

Will be more silent now, started my new job which means I need to focus and have less time to spent on projects.  
Stay great - cheers.

## What happend

Print of the day: [Bambus printable mouse](https://makerworld.com/en/models/13716).

Took longer than expected.  
First fail - print not stuck to the build plate - spaghetti. OK, no show stopper. Cleaning my build plate and add some brim to strenghten up the part and slowing down the print at a specific hight. 

Second fail two hours later - stuck again, this time the printhead continued printing but no filament was extruded for a bunch of layers. I tried to remove the filament but it was stuck, stuck so hard it took me quite a while to realize it must be stuck in the extruder.

## Fix

First and foremost you need to disassemble the hotend. Sounds hard but, compared to the Voron 2.4 this was a quick and easy one.

- Open the print head front plate (magnetic)
- Removing two screws for the hotend
- Loosen up the filament cutter
- Remove 4 screws for the extruder
- Remove the extruders controller board
Quicker than removing the glue holding the connector in.
- Disassemble the complete extruder  
Seriously watch [Bambus manual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLlT1RV-oJE)!
- Extruder cleanup
Heat up an allen key wrench and press it in the filament which is stuck in the extruder, wait until it has cooled down. Now heat up the extruder (filament change temp) and act like doing a cold pull.
- Assemble
Put all the stuff back together - double check - run a self test.

Be careful, this is no tutorial! Watch videos you can burn yourself, you can burn down the printer and even more. If you don't feel safe get some help from a professional!

## Conculsion

Buy a fully assembled hotend to swap, just in case.  
But all in all, easy and printer already back in business.  
Sometimes it should be IðŸ’€Tech instead of Iâ™¥Tech.

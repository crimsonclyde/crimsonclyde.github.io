## Exordium
Since a couple of years I own a LotusGrill and the pain was always the batteries. You need a fan to operate that Grill. Don't laugh, the system is quite impressive. Quick starting time (5 mins) and less charcoal usage. 

What you need is a USB Cable. Best one cable with already only + and - connected to the USB Plug. Soldering iron and a power bank. Conversation time 5 mins. Pro Tip: Secure the cable with (hot) glue.

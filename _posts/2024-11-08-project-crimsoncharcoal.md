## Introduction

Winter is coming—or perhaps we’re destined to float forever in a sea of fog.  
For days, the view outside has been nothing short of dismal. Thick fog, day after day, without a single break!   
What better time to dive into a new, hands-on project?  

For years, I’ve dreamed of creating a "River Table." Since ChatGPT’s already given this intro a polish, let’s spare you the hassle and go straight to the point: a river table is an artistic fusion of wood and resin. This unique design typically involves pieces of wood arranged to create a flowing, river-like gap, which is then filled with resin. The result is a striking visual of wood and resin coming together, creating the illusion of a natural waterway captured in a table.

If you haven’t encountered one before, you’re in for a treat!

## Project Crimson&Charcoal

You could call this project "Not Another River Table, Please." I’m not aiming for the classic river-and-wood look; instead, I'm going for something that feels like blood and fire—hence, crimson and charcoal.

Wood comes with a pretty hefty price tag these days. But more importantly, I’m not willing to harm the planet by using rainforest wood or fancy driftwood. Cheap materials are fine by me—my inner rebel insists. I’m terrified, but no pain, no gain. And, with the help of Mark Watney, we’re going to pull it off. More precicly in his words: "I'm gonna have to science the shit out of this." So, I'll start with a test setup, hours of videos, and blogs—you name it.

- Jigsaw to cut along the traces
- Mill with some cutting tools prepare rougher edges
- Grinding machine for smoothing

- Rotary blade cutter for the roughly cuttings walls to retain the resin

- Standard WS2812b LEDs cut and re-soldered toghether again
- Test WLED System 
- Resin tape on the surface of the metal sheet

Now waiting for the resin to be delivered and a day, that is maybe a bit warmer than today.

## To Do List

1. Build the frame
2. Use chaulk to make it as leak proof as possible and to prevent resin from going under the wood
3. Superglue to be sure the LEDs are sticking to the bottom
4. Brush to seal the wood so no air is drawn into the resin
5. Since we don't deal with much of a hight, I hope I can pour it in one go

The last step is the one that is the most problematic. Mess up the ratio, dust, temperature did I not forgot anything. 
Fingers crossed. Cheers - over and out.

# Exordium

Ever wanted to try your own Mate brew?  
Well, it's about time. Another DIY project I [saw recently online](https://youtu.be/9uBnJAEiDug?si=RQA-mN4EIRu-Nola).  
So, why not give it a shot?

The time is right to the spot, [Håck ma's castle!](https://hack-mas.at) is close, and the Team23 is in need of more Mate.

## Ingredients

- Mate  
  I used Cruz De Malta
- 150g sugar
- 7g Citric acid powder
- Pinch of salt
- Food coloring (yellow) - Optional
- Sparkling Water

# Recipe

This translates roughly to 1,65 litre

## Mate Sirup

### Brew oversaturated Mate

- Boil 1 litre of water  
  Use a water filter with activated charcoal to filter out most of the calcium carbonate.  
  Makes your brew much smoother.
- Remove the heat  
- Put in 200g of your mate tea powder into the water
- Wait 10 minutes  
  Meanwhile steer your brew so everything is soak and we get the most out of the powder/leafs.
- Strain  
  Strain everything and press out all water which saturated the mate powder/leafs.
- Fine strain  
  Use a towle and coffee / teafilters later on to strain out as much mate residue as possible.   
  Repeat last step a few times.

You should have somehow between 300-450ml fine strained, oversaturated mate tea.

### Reduce / Create Sirup

- Put the strained oversaturated tea into a pot
- Add 150g of sugar 
- Steer and cook to reduce it to roughtly 150ml
- Add 7g of citric acid powder
- Add a pinch of salt
- Add 5 drops of yellow food coloring

## Mix

Now final step is to dilute our Sirup with super sparkly water.  
Ratio: 1:10 means 150ml of Mate Sirup and 1,5l of the super sparkly water. 


# Lessons learned from Batch01

- It's sweet, maybe less sugar (130g max).  
- Use more water maybe 1:12 / 1:13
- Increase the soak time by 4-5 mins so total 15 minutes
- Use HEAVY sparkling water!

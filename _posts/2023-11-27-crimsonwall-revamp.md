I'm particular about lighting, especially indoors. I dislike direct light, neon tubes, and similar products from local retailers. Consequently, I've had to take matters into my own hands. Over the years, I've come up with some innovative ideas, and together with Moondust, we've managed to bring these quirky concepts to life.

However, some of these lamps need revising, and the project most in need of an update is CrimsonWall.

The light strip I originally used was an inexpensive, older model. While neither of these factors is problematic on their own, combined with an IoT power plug, the strip began to emit random glows due to voltage leaks. Moreover, changing the light programs was only possible with a remote control. The final straw was that the remote's frequency was the same as my projector's. Turning on the projector would inadvertently change the light strip to pink. It was an absolute nightmare and totally unacceptable.

The solution was a complete overhaul using WS2812b LED light strips and WLED control. I even replaced the IoT power plug with a flashed Tasmota solution. My goal is to move away from my old Kasa IoT devices, which are cloud-based and consume too much power.

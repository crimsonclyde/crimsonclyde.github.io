A normal evening in ÖggÖgg.\
Last night we managed to summon the [W48 Tischfernsprecher](https://clyde.crimson.space/posts/20230521/) back to life.

## Current state

- Calling via a digital/analog konverter works
- Microphone works
- Speaker works
- Calling someone doesn't  

Right now, we have no clue why, we did some testings and we are pretty sure that from a technical perspective all seems to work fine.\
So you can call and talk to us, but we cannot ring you back.\
All in all, this is was just proof-of-concept.\
8 bucks, I am pretty pleased with this outcome!

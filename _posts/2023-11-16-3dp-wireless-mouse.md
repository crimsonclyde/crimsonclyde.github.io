Last post I mentioned the problems with the top shell of the 3d printed wireless mouse from Bambu Labs. Actually it seems to be my fault, obviously it is my fault.  
I never tuned or did something special for the filament I buy from DasFilament. It works for allmost everything, but turns out overhangs are the allmost in everything. Swapped the filament from DasFilament to a roll of Bambu Labs filament and without any problems, print finished successfull.

Love this piece of printer. Worth every penny.  
I never want to look back. Buying a cheap printer, modify it update it and end up with 600 bucks for a piece that breaks every minute and you waste your time repairing the printer or looking for a broken print. Over and over again.  
Yes, you do a good practise and you learn how 3d printers work, but mostly it's frustrating. Time is a precious thing so why not spend a few bucks more and do with the tool what it is suppose to do - print.

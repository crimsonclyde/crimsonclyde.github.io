Hammer time! Well, no more tool time!
Just out of pure fun, I decided to build the cheap pizza oven found on the internet.  
Bricks - that's all about it, bits of iron bars and an angle grinder and off you go.  

So, wish us luck - friday test - saturday production!
I will do a lead test just to be double safe.

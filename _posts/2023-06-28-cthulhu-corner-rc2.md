Release candidate 2 of my Cthulhu Corner.  
Added some green stuff and additional lighting.

Another thing to make for it is a LED Lamp bought back the days from IKEA.  
Since we don't have a proper place for the lamp, I would like to give it a new home.  
But I need to create some holder and a fitting for the E27 fitting.

So here is my first shot which I came up with today:

I will glue those pieces together tomorrow and see if it attaches properly on the  
Honeycomb Wall. More to come? Well yes, one final piece is in shipping state and  
I will get my hands on it next week I would guess.

After that we can finally say, job's done, but until then, stay tuned!

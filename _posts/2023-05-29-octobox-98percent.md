The Caddy Octobox 98% done.\
Works great so far.

Missing: 

- Possibilty to connect the boxes in the middle
- Possibility to secure them without lashing strap around

Both ideas are already in development and will be integrated next one or two weeks.\
Turns out great. \
Thanks for all who lend a hand or tools to get this project to reality.

Update to the project Awakening.
Big shoutout to Lu who magnificient created the tentacles with Blender - thx a ton for the creation and spending your precious time.
The files are printed in FDM with PLA. Painted black, highlights with Rub'n Buff bronze and silver and finally sealed with Montana hologram varnish.
Bases are printed in a translucent FDM PLA. Printend on my old Ender 3 Pro by Lu.

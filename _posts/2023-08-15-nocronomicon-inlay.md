Big shoutout to Jamyra El Khaleel (aka. MaryGold) for the wonderful artwork. Based on the replica probs by: [Elderprops](http://elderprops.com/necronomicon-evildead-1981/). WLED, ESP32 D1 Mini, 2 RGB LEDs and a bit of CAD magic and 3d print and voila; the inside looks already presentable.

>  	...Men know him as the Dweller in Darkness, that brother of the Old Ones called Nyogtha, the  Thing that should not be. He can be summoned to Earth's surface through certain secret caverns  and fissures, and sorcerers have seen him in Syria and below the black tower of Leng: from the   Thang Grotto of Tartary he has come ravening to bring terror and destruction among the pavilions  of the great Khan. Only by the looped cross, by the Vach-Viraj incantation, and by the Tikkoun  elixir may he be driven back to the nighted caverns of hidden foulness where he dwelleth...

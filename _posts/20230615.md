Fka. Cthulhu Cave Lantern project:
[A background sage](https://clyde.crimson.space/posts/20230614/).\
The lantern is now mounte to the main tile and flush to the wall. The only missing part is the to measure the wire from power supply to the RGB LED matrix panel. I assume a voltage drop due to the long cable which needs further investigation.


**Why Lovecraft Laboratory?**\
I do absolutely like the two CCs in Cthulhu Cave but I hate the sound of it. It's just to man cave style. So the Cthulhu Cave will be renamed to ♥Craft Laboratory. I do think that has a darker tone in the sound. I had factory in mind as well, but I would miss the same letters like Cthulhu Cave CC and Lovecraft Laboratory two L.... we try to stay consistend, right?

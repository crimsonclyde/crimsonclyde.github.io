title: "Iâ™¥Craft: Cthulhu Cave Lantern - A background saga"
---

 There is a redesign of a entire wall in my room in progress.\
 Expect awesomeness!
 
 Today I used my angel grinder (yes this typo is wanted) to carve the background wood for the lantern.\
 Used different oil to protect the wood to optically age it a tiny bit. First try and I like it.

Power stride and ready to ride!

Final - finished and fixed version of [Techniccontroller`s Wordclock](https://techniccontroller.com/word-clock-with-wifi-and-neopixel/).

I am very pleased with the results since I wanted this clock nearly forever since I saw it first somewhere in a Sauna years ago.

As you can see in the oncoming image, there is light bleeding.
Point One: LEDs on photos are always overexposed
Point Two: The acrylic glass bends to fix it I would need to change the acrylic to real glass
Point Three: Doesn't look that bad in reality.

Anyway, all in all, great project great talks with Edgar (from Techniccontroller) which helped me finding the right spot to [fix the code](https://github.com/techniccontroller/wordclock_esp8266/pull/22) in the end. Now the english version works perfectly. I can absolutly recommend this build. And once again open-source is often a great community where you get help and provide some if you can.

Well, I would lie if I wouldn't tell ya, that this was the second attempt. Accidently I mixed one ground and VIN. Luckily it didn't destroyed the LED strips. Quick resolder and finally. Lights, camera - action.\
As always, this is controlled by [Aircookies WLED](https://kno.wled.ge/), as mentioned a million times now - this project is wonderful and it saves a bunch of time.

Some hot glue to pull the cables to the backside, and last not least adding a diffusor foil to get a blur effect.

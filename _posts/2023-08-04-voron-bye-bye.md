As much as I like tech sometimes I realise I just have to much of it.  
Furthermore, you start learning that time is a limiting factor, by just getting older.

Why did I say bye bye to a printer I really loved?  
Couple of reasons which came to my mind as I think about it:

- It was bought by my old company and therefore a part which always reminds me about them
- I had always strange problems which no one else had
- Parts brake, and I had to buy new parts since I was not able to print them, obviously
- No Filament changer
- Updating the printer took way to much time

I want to print parts, for my projects, I don't need a new project where I can waste more time on.
So today at 1o'clock it finally happend. My Voron 2.4 left the building.  
I replaced all parts of the Beta Stealthburner to the final version and with the help of Murphy we
upgraded to HartK's Stealthburner Toolhead which is a lot cleaner than the old connectors.

I'm saying goodbye to you  
Say goodbye, bye bye love.

Imagine the most vexatious dog.  
Like a terrier, you know them under the term West Highland White Terrorists.  
Always barking with that sound of *eff eff*. Something coming to your mind?  
Good - now let's give this dog a name, a proper one. Fitting to this uttering
annoyance. Anubis!

Yes, that's a package to swallow.  
Still lmao - still that sound ringing in my ears: *eff eff*

Of course that needs to be utalized, I mean that is a opportunity.  
Low hanging fruits, page turner, a full blown new story right out of ÖggÖgg.

Therefore, and since I decided to go for a new NAS system and in reminisence to the mighty anubis *eff eff* behold:

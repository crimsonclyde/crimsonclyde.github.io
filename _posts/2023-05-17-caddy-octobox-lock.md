Adding yacht locks to MaryGolds Caddy OctoBoxes.\
The box was designed with Autodesks Fusion 360 and later edited by my local carpenter workshop. \
The entire case is cut out with a CNC machine.\

Some modifcations needs to be done, since there already was a cutout for opening the boxes.\
However we need some locking mechanism to keep the boxes closed during the journey.

**This right now is the result:**

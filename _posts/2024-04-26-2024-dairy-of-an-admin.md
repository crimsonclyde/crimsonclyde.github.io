I need to tell you, the entire story, no excuses! Just stepping into darkness without looking back. Roll on snare drum. Everybody's angry. Curtains:

A while back, I switched from Windows 11 to Linux Mint, which became my daily driver. It worked. A bit outdated, but always avoid buying stuff from Realtek if you ever consider working with a Linux system one day.

I bought a mini PC, specifically a GMKTec Nucbox G3—a pretty decent small machine that takes less power than my big tower with a beefy Nvidia RTX 4070 Ghost graphics card. I installed Arch Linux for the first time there, and it works as well as my Linux Mint. It again became my daily driver. Even with Fusion360, BambuStudio, and some other programs, I hadn't expected to see there.

So, after a while, I decided I don't need anything from my big tower anymore. I could reinstall it with the same system running on my Nucbox. The small PC just lacks graphic power. Normally no big deal, but sometimes you can feel with CAD or some games that the oomph is just absent.

## Rant (Linux)

... and so, some fine day (today), I decided to give it a shot and reinstall the entire machine with Arch Linux and KDE Plasma 6 from scratch. Maybe Hyprland, who knows. I did a lot and tried a lot, read a lot, but faced problems and crap at every step I took. Every step forward was one back, you know the drill. WiFi is still in 2024 a big deal when it comes down to Linux. You can have luck or you end up in a mess. Sorry for those words, but it's just reality. At one stage, there was a connection, but it stopped after 5 minutes. RTL8852BE—just don't choose this card. It's a mess. Was and still is. Even under Windows, you need the right drivers first.

Next on the list wasting precious life time - graphics. I tried the proprietary drivers and Nouveau. The proprietary one just didn't work at all. Black screen right after the greeter. Nouveau was able to start a desktop environment but then crashed hard when the machine went to sleep. People all over the place report just bad things when dealing with Nvidia drivers on Linux nowadays. You spend a hell lot of money on those cards and end up knee deep in hell.

Rearranging your pencil collection is much more meaningful than spending a quarter of the day trying to get WiFi or the display driver to run.
Conclusion: No Linux on my big machine. It will be Windows again, even if I don't like it. I am just fed up and don't want a machine that's so fragile it breaks on the next system update.

## Rant (Windows)

Windows 11 it is. Well, folks—everyone likes bloatware.
So what do you do nowadays in 2024? Here's the story, think about how absurd it is:

1. Download Windows 11
1. Put Windows 11 on a USB stick
1. Install Windows 11
1. Download Windows 11 on Windows 11
1. Download Tiny11Builder
1. Run Tiny11Builder
1. Put Windows 11 on a USB stick
1. Install Windows 11 (Tiny)
1. Start using it by removing more bloatware...

That is a system I have paid for! And WiFi doesn't work—of course. Searching now for a LAN cable and some cheap vodka to ease my pain.

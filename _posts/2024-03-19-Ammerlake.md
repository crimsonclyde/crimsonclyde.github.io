It's been a while but this season I def. plan to see some mountains again.  
Maybe this time with a bike. Age finally takes it's toll and it feels like not everything is in perfect balance anymore. But regardless of those tiny issues, solutions are to be set in place.

## Specs

Track length: 46,8km  
Duration: 2h12m  
Average speed: 21,3 km/h

Mostly done in Track Mode and two times Turbo used (end of the track).

All in all last hour was quite hard, My back started to hurt a lot, as well as the left hip.  
I would assume most of those issues are due to no training at all, and I took 2 breaks only during the track. None longer than 5 mins.

All in all it was great and the weather conditions decent. Nothing to complain.

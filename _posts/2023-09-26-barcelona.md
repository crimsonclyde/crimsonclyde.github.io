## Exordium

After nearly 10 years it seems, back in a city that has changed. Tourism and capitalism all over the place. No, this is not a rant. I need to admit, all things considered, it is simply unbearable to see a lovely place like that, a city flooded with random stupiddiy. Most of them brain dead and from a social point of view just shallow.

Blithering idiots!  
I am still shocked how everyone prefer beeing uniform over individuality and wisdom - egosim over looking after each other.

Apart from that - still one of my favorite places in the world. I will come back, but not for tourism just for catching up with my friends. Miss u!

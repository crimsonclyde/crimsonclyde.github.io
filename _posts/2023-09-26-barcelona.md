## Exordium

After nearly 10 years it seems, back in a city that has changed. Tourism and capitalism all over the place. No this is not a rant. Tis' simply unbearable to see a lovely place like that city flooded with random tourists. Most of them brain dead and from a social point of view shallow.

Blittering idiots - Period.

Apart from that - still one of my favorite places in the world. I will come back, but not for tourism just for meeting friends again. Miss u!

This is a follow up to [Cheapest Pizza Oven](https://clyde.crimson.space/posts/cheapest-pizza-oven/). The same procedure like last year the shed party started with rain, heavy rain. Apart from that a great happening. Tons of friends, Pizza, Guitar Hero, booze. What could go possible wrong? Nothing. OK, apart from a seed in my mind that I start to think I only know Scrooge McDuck's.

Fuck it - talk is cheap!

Here a few picutres from the actual thing!
I used a infrared thermometer to measure the temps. You need something like >250°C on the middle stone where you put your pizza. Use plenty of flour and don't put to much on your pizza or you will have hard times to get it into the oven.
I recommend some pine wood to start and then hard wood to settle the temps on the higher level.
Taste was great and I mysteriously managed it to not lose one pizza.

Have fun. Cheers

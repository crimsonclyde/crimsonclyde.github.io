Finally, a proof that we are living in a giant simulation. But before we dive into the rabbit hole I need to tell you a few things and hope to inspire you to give yourself a proof. Apart from that we also need to tell you, I can run the experiment only to a specific point; exactly we can run the "Double Slit Experiment" but not the "Observer Effect". Follow me deep down into the rabbit hole.

## #1 The Story
What makes a simulation a simulation, well to be honest, we can only explain it from our own persepective; out of our own simulation. Think about computer games. It would be impossible to show you, by computing power, the whole world you are playing in. We don't have the technology and we don't need to compute (render) the universe, simply because you don't look at it. You only see the screen and this is a fraction of the "world" we simulate, show you.

Bear with me, it sounds complicated but it isn't! We just need to be on the same point of view and that is why I try to explain it from the beginning. Ok, back on track. So as long as we don't look there is a blurr to the rest of the world, the computer renders it only aproximately but not in detail. Because no one is looking, why waste power here?


## #2 Double Slit Expermiment

We know only a bit of what happens in our world, and some of the stuff we think we a certain is just wrong. Like light, we expect light to behave in a certain matter. Well, it's time to trouble your mind.

Everyone knows a stick from their school time, a pointer where the teacher pointed to a specific part of a map and we were forced to answer which continent that part was. The newer version of this stick is a laser pointer. A light source emitting a narrow coherent laser beam of visible light. We just se the dot at the end, right? Correct, faboulas, nearly there! If we introduce debri (like steam or fog) we see the beam from the laserpointer until it reaches a object. A clear solid beam of light; Loveparade feeling.

> Warning
> This is a experimental setup where you use a laser pointer, those laserpointers are harmful if pointed to your eyes. You can blind yourself and for regarless of which create running through your experiment! Take pre-, and extra-caution!


This is now our experimental setup for the experiment. The left side is just our canvas the object where we point the beam to. On the right we have the light source, our laserpointer. Right now we don't interrupt the beam and we get what we expect.

Perfect! Now let's interfere the light beam from our laser pointer.

Whaaaaaat?
I mean really? What happen's here? There is something obviously wrong here. Let's introduce fog, maybe the light beam is split up and that's the reason why this happens, right.

more?

Seriously? What happens here?

## #3 The Observer Effect

You saw what happend, but this is just the introduction to the phenomenon I release now. Why is our reality a simulation? Ok, forget about the laserbeam. Think about the laserbeam is a gun that fires particles, like electrons, super small marbels. 

![Double-Slit Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment#/media/File:Double-slit.svg)

Now we fire one electron at a time so they are not getting in the way of each other and you should see on the experiment screen a pattern - like the two slits we have. Bit blurry but two, right?  
Well, yes and no - suprisingly.

I mentioned that blur effect from video games. Electrons are so small and we cannot see them. So the game renders those particles blurred and we get a wave pattern instead of a interference pattern. But why?

Hope you are still obboard our vessel of mysteries. Let's imagine we introduce a device a detector in front of the double slit to see what happens to those particles. Are they split up, are they going to each slit at the same time or through no slit or anywhere (super position)?

The detector can now what our human I cannot. See these particles and they act like you would look with a human eye on them. The simulation knows now it is beeing watched so it renders the correct pattern. We see now the interference pattern on our canvas - and now anything else is the same experimental setup. We only introduced the detector!

You don't believe me, well, that's the exercise for your weekend. Your private rabbit hole! Have fun and don't get lost!

We finally have proof that we're living in a giant simulation. But before we dive down the rabbit hole, there are a few things you need to know. I hope to inspire you to seek evidence for yourself. Additionally, I should mention that while we can demonstrate the "Double Slit Experiment," we cannot replicate the "Observer Effect". Join me as we journey deep into the rabbit hole.

## #1 The Story
What defines a simulation as a simulation? Honestly, we can only explain it from our own perspective, from within our own simulated reality. Consider computer games. We can't possibly show you the entirety of the game world using just our computing power. Current technology doesn't allow it, nor do we need to render the entire universe, because you're not observing all of it at once. You only see what's on your screen, which is a fraction of the "world" we simulate and present to you.

It might sound complex, but it's not! We just need to align our viewpoints. With that out of the way, let's move on. When a part of the game world isn't being observed, it remains vague or blurry. There's no need for the computer to render it in full detail since no one's looking. Why waste computational resources?


## #2 Double Slit Expermiment

Our understanding of the world is limited, and some things we once believed true have been proven incorrect. Take light, for example; we expect it to behave in a certain way. Let's challenge that assumption.

Most of us are familiar with pointers from school – sticks used by teachers to indicate parts of a map. The modern version is the laser pointer: a device that emits a narrow, coherent laser beam. We see only its endpoint, right? But when introduced to particulates like steam or fog, the beam becomes visible until it hits an object. It appears as a solid stream of light, reminiscent of a parade.

> Warning: This experimental setup involves a laser pointer. Laser pointers can cause harm if directed at eyes. They have the potential to cause blindness, whether to you or any creature that might accidentally cross its path. Exercise extreme caution!

This is our experimental setup. The left side is our target, where the laser hits. On the right, we have our light source: the laser pointer. Without any interference, the result is predictable.

But when we introduce an interference...

Surprised? Let's introduce fog to see if the light beam splits.

Still not clear?

Confused about what's happening?

## #3 The Observer Effect

You've seen the unexpected results, but that's just the beginning. Why might our reality be a simulation? Forget the laser beam for a moment. Imagine it's a gun firing particles, like electrons.

We'll fire electrons one at a time, so they don't interfere with each other. You'd expect to see a pattern on the screen reflecting the two slits, right? The answer is both yes and no, surprisingly.

I mentioned the blurring effect in video games. Electrons are so tiny that they aren't directly observable. The "game" (our reality) renders these particles as a wave pattern rather than an interference pattern. But why?

Stay with me on this journey of mysteries. If we place a detector before the double slits, it can detect these particles in a way our eyes can't. When the "simulation" realizes it's being observed, it renders the expected pattern. Introducing only the detector changes the outcome!

If you're skeptical, I encourage you to try it out for yourself. Dive into your personal exploration and see where it leads!

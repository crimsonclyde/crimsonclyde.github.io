## Introduction

More CAD, this time an addition to my Cthulhu Corner or shrine, whatever you wanna call it.
Classic Chinese symbols in a more traditional style neon Hongkong style.

So how it works, basically simple you use these symbols to form Kèsūlǔ that sounds more or less like Cthulhu.

**克 = Kè**

**苏 = sū**

**鲁 = lǔ**


## CAD

Bit challenging to create the perforated look. If you use "rectangular pattern" to much in both direction, AutoDesk Fusion360 becomes unresponsive and you wait for quite some time until you can do the next task. Quite problematic, when you have created the pattern, every tasks takes ages, regardless what you are doing. Export for 3D print was another funny twist. If you pattern is to small and there is not enough space in between the holes then you will see that the pattern in the slicer, but it refuses to print it. Without a warning. This took additional time to change the pattern, wait again forever for Fusion360 to complete the task to realise: Sh*** still to small walls. Rinse and repeat from that moment on until I had what I wanted:

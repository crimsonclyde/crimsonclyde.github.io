title: "Iâ™¥Craft: Cthulhu Corner - RC1"
---

Redesign of the Lovecraft / Cthulhu Mythos shrine, calling it - Cthulhu Corner.  
I found the project called [Honeycomb Wall](https://www.printables.com/de/model/152592-honeycomb-storage-wall)  and I tried to imagine how to use this   
project abroad from his initial intention of a tool holder to a interior  
design for a background. It is not only beautyful it is practical to add stuff to to and change it  
whenever I think I need to.

So long story short with some finds recently and through the years, plus some presents and paintings from @Marygold  
it's time to fire up the printer and run through a bunch of prints.

#### Facts
Print time is just the time while printing the part, not the time to slice it, prepare it and change filament.

Print time: 
- Panels 4 days 
- Connectors and hooks: 23h

Filament used:
- 3,5 spools of DasFilament Matt Black


Additional I found a Edision Wax Cylinder for the Edision Phonograph in an antique store in Regensburg.  
We now can add the Lovecraft Laboratory Lantern to it and place various object I would put roughly in this time  
to the wall and cabinet. Of course the [W48 Fernsprecher](https://clyde.crimson.space/posts/20230521/) (Telephone) with some additional changes to the dial.

And finally - the result which will be updated with some additional parts in near future.

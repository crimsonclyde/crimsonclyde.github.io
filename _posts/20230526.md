The idea and basic CAD design I made a year ago. Maybe more.
Some iterations later, the Octoboxes getting their final touches. I would suggest to get harder wood than we did. We decided to use plywood - but this has downsites, scratches and dents since the wood has a soft top layer. Basically, we are happy happy - we decided to not do it once again, to save ressources. It works, we tested both boxes already in Sardina successfully.\
What's missing? Final polishing, drying, remounting and maybe a cross mount between the two boxex. There is something in my mind, but right now I am not entirely sure how do deal with it. There's stuff to conisder, like load changes, breaking and twisiting during the journey. However - the first real finished product is done and maybe I will tweak it later. Depending on people I can ask two weld stuff.

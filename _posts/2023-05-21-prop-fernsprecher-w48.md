According to Wikipedia the W48 for "Wahlfernsprecher 1948" this is the first post World War II desktop telephone line developed in the mid 30ies by Siemens & Halske for German telephone and postal administration, later Deutsche Post. It was developed until 1961 and it is still produced until today in small quantities using the originial mold.

Lovecraft universe sets in the 1920ies so this one is a produced 20 years later.
However, the basic design is close to the W28 (Tischfernsprecher 1925) - so it's a start.

A Western Electric desk stand telephone (Candlestick Telephone) would be much more close - but hard to find.
So right now, this is what we have and thanks to MaryGold now another prop for my I♥Craft Cave ready to be on display

## Cleaning

Let's see, the phone shell is made from Bakalite. Bakelite is mostly a mixture of Phenol and a world famous resin called formaldehyde. 
Famous for it's feature to be carcinogene. More info can be found on [Cancer.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/formaldehyde#:~:text=What%20is%20formaldehyde%3F,and%20other%20pressed%2Dwood%20products.)

So, as far as I understand, the mixture between phenol and formaldehyde is pretty save since they form a new compound material.
I would suggest to avoid cutting/grinding the material without proper respiration filtering.

### Process

1. Clean it with dishwatering detergent
2. Polish paste\
I had troubles with this, because it filled the small gaps with the yellowish paste and it looks dull even after endless polishing
3. Black shoe polish\
The general gothic wonder wappon. Standard black shoe polish! Time

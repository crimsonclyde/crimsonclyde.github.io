title: "Iâ™¥Craft: ManiacMeteor - Revamp"

---

It has been a while since I had the ManiacMeteor project here in my blog.\
It's time to re-vamp the project, fix problems and update the wiring.\
What else to say as: Let's get it on:


## Disassemble / Paint

## Cable management speakers

The side mounted stereo speakers getting a new connector to help dissassemble the entire project without breaking stuff all the time. Updated and reprinted the holders to have screws instead of glue.

## Clydepressions

A few impressions during tests.\
I had to remove the DSP (mixer) which means less control but the DSP turned out to be a mess. Sometimes music doesn't play, stops or stutteres. Even after reboot sometimes there was just no sound. Since I removed the plugin it feels way more stable and reliable. However, stability over functionality.

| *That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons even death may die.*

Somebody out there get's to know me pretty well already.  
Will the Cthulhu Corner ever be finished, she asked.    
Of course not! It would be a shame if so, right?   

So again, I started once again to listen to the whispers from strange lands.  
Summoned by the elder gods, they urged me to forge another magical object from the eternal void.

Before I start to spoiler to much, I  need to admit that I stand upon the shoulder of giants here.  
Without the work of others I simply had no Idea how to start.   
I will reference those elder gods of crafting in the upcoming posts.  
Stay tuned.

# Necronomicon - Release Candidate 01

Finally and after a lot of hassle with gathering the material for building this ultimate piece of darkness. May I present to you: The Necronomicon. The grimoir, the book of the dead, Kitlab al-Azif. The book written by Abdul Alhazred somewhere around 700 CE. Alhazred died mysteriously in 738CE. According to Ibn Khallikan, happened when he was "seized by an invisible monster in broad daylight and devoured horribly before a large number of fright-frozen witnesses".
This grimoir contained magical spells and incantations for summoning monsters and archaic deitie. Brought to Alhazred, the half-crazy worshipper, by Yog Sothoth and Cthulhu.

Tis' of course only a replica, a prop, a reminisence of the original one. One of the few translations made during the centuries. Those copies are well hidden. The last public official remaining copy was once stored in a library in the U.S. Until a few years ago, a specific persona lent it and it was never seen again. Only the checkout receipt still shows the culprit:
The Necronomicon checked out by A. Alhazred. 

Coinsistence? 

Anyway, there might be other copies out. Most are lost in time and space. Rumours still mention one more possibility: The Vatican Vaults. Maybe you can drop them a message, if you are still part of their cult? 

What's left? We know nothing for sure and we will never fully uncover the horrors which were buried in Alhazreds Book of the Dead. We will never know what was lost during the translations and the creation of those newer and manual copies. A secret forever sleeping in R'lyeh.

The Necronomicon famous and mysterious. Bound in human flesh, compressed by the the mythos itself, written in blood. Cthulhu fhtagn!

# Necronomicon - Release Candidate 01

Finally and after a lot of hassle with gathering the material for building this ultimate piece of darkness. May I present to you: The Necronomicon. The grimoir, the book of the dead, Kitlab al-Azif. The book written by Abdul Alhazred somewhere around 700 CE. Alhazred died mysteriously in 738CE. According to Ibn Khallikan, happened when he was "seized by an invisible monster in broad daylight and devoured horribly before a large number of fright-frozen witnesses".
This grimoir contained magical spells and incantations for summoning monsters and archaic deitie. Brought to Alhazred, the half-crazy worshipper, by Yog Sothoth and Cthulhu.

Tis' of course only a replica, a prop, a reminisence of the original one. One of the few translations made during the centuries. Those copies are well hidden. The last public official remaining copy was once stored in a library in the U.S. Until a few years ago, since they switch to digital checkouts, you were still able to proof it to yourself by browsing through the check out cards:
The Necronomicon checked out by A. Alhazred. Coinsistence? 

There might be other copies out. Most of them are lost in time and space. Only one more - a rumour mentions the Vatican Vaults, I would suggest you write them if you are still part of their religion. What we know is we will never fully uncover the horrors which are buried and locked away. What did get lost during the translations and the creation of those manual copies will remain forever lost in R'lyeh.

The Necronomicon famous and mysterious. Bound in human flesh and written in blood.
